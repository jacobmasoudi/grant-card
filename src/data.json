                "topic_description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\r\n\r\nThe NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic or skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate the lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives and Scope\r\n\r\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews or other procedures of clinical research; however, applications that propose to conduct intervention studies will not be considered responsive to the FOA and will not be reviewed.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\r\n\r\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\r\n\r\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\r\n\r\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\r\n\r\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\r\n\r\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics\r\n\r\nCollaboration between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\r\n\r\nCommercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers, especially women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons, to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\r\n\r\nMilestone\r\n\r\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives, in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.",

                "topic_description": "The educational objective of this FOA is to provide opportunities for eligible SBCs to submit NIH SBIR grant applications to develop IDM STEM products that address student career choice and health and medicine topics for: (1) pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12) students and teachers or (2) informal science education (ISE) audiences. The second educational objective is to inform the American public that their quality of health is defined by lifestyle. If this message is understood, people can begin to live longer and reduce the healthcare burden to society. Therefore, this FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. The research objective of this FOA is the development of new educational products that will advance our understanding of how IDM STEM-based gaming can improve student learning. It is anticipated that increasing underserved and minority student achievement in STEM fields through IDM STEM resources will encourage these students to pursue health-related careers that will increase their economic and social opportunities. A diverse health care workforce will help to expand health care access for the underserved, foster research in neglected areas of societal need, and enrich the pool of managers and policymakers to meet the needs of a diverse population.\r\n\r\nIDM is a bridge technology that converts game-based activities from a social pastime to a powerful educational tool that challenges students with problem solving, conceptual reasoning and goal-oriented decision making. Well-designed IDM products mimic successful teacher pedagogy and exploit student interest in games for learning. IDM STEM products also integrate imbedded learning, e.g., what the student knows and new knowledge gained in the gaming process, into problem solving skills. IDM products provide real time student assessment. Unlike standardized classroom testing where student achievement is a pass or fail process, IDM-based assessment is interactive, does not punish the student, and provides feedback on how to move to the next level of play. IDM products are intended to generate long-term changes in student performance, educational outcomes and career choices.\r\n\r\nThis FOA also encourages IDM STEM products that will increase public health literacy and stimulate behavioral changes towards a healthier lifestyle. Types of applications submitted to this FOA may vary with the target audience, scientific content, educational purpose and method of delivery. IDM STEM products may include but are not limited to: game-based curricula, resources that promote attitude changes toward learning, new skills development, teamwork and group activities, public participation in scientific research (citizen science) projects, and behavioral changes in lifestyle and health. IDM STEM products designed to increase the number of underserved students, e.g., American Indian, Alaska Native, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, disabled, or otherwise underrepresented individuals considering careers in basic, behavioral or clinical research are encouraged.\r\n\r\nIDM STEM products may be designed for use in-classroom or out-of-classroom settings, e.g., as supplements to existing classroom curricula, for after-school science clubs, libraries, hospital waiting rooms and science museums. IDM products may target children in group settings or individually, with or without adult or teacher participation or supervision.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project may use any IDM gaming technology or platform but the platform chosen should be accessible to the target group.\r\n\r\n",

IoT is not a single technology, but rather involves the convergence of sensor, actuator, information, and communication technologies. Emerging IoT implementations will use smaller and more energy-efficient embedded sensor technologies, more sophisticated actuators, enhanced communications, and advanced data analytics to collect and aggregate information and enable intelligent systems that understand context, track and manage complex interactions, and anticipate requirements. Market verticals that are potentially impacted by innovations in this area include connected cities and homes, smart transportation, smart agriculture, industrial IoT, and retail IoT. ",

It is expected that the application of these new tools and technologies will ultimately lead to new ways to identify, treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.\r\n\r\nNIH is one of several federal agencies involved in the BRAIN Initiative. Planning for the NIH component of the BRAIN initiative is guided by the long-term scientific plan, \"BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision,\" which details seven high-priority research areas and calls for a sustained federal commitment of $4.5 billion over 12 years. This report can be found at http://braininitiative.nih.gov/. This FOA and other FOAs issued in Fiscal Year 2018 are based on NIH&#39;s careful consideration of the recommendations of the BRAIN 2025 Report, and input from the NIH BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the National BRAIN initiative, the NIH continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research and in technology development, including through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. \r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nBased on the priority areas identified by the BRAIN 2025, and in further evaluation of the neurotechnologies currently available to neuroscience researchers, it was determined that there is a need to enable broad dissemination of tools/technologies that improve our understanding of brain function. Many of these inventions require additional research and development (R&D) before they can be disseminated to the broader neuroscience community. To fill this research gap, this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) which uses the STTR grant mechanism, will support to support the development of novel neuroscience tools and technologies in order to better understand the structure and function of brain circuits- a major goal of the BRAIN Initiative. This FOA will support further development of neurotechnologies developed through the BRAIN initiative or through other funding programs in preparation for commercial dissemination.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the activities proposed will require partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and Small Business Concerns (SBCs), which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple program directors/principal investigators. \r\n\r\nExamples of neurotechnologies that would be appropriate for this FOA include, but are not limited to, development of: \r\n\r\nWhile some of the markets for these products may be small, NIH is supportive of developing these technologies towards sustainable commercial manufacture. The full development and dissemination of these technologies will enable neuroscientists to perform novel hypothesis-driven experiments that are not feasible and/or reduce barriers to experiments that currently are too costly, difficult, or time consuming to perform broadly.   \r\n\r\nFor more information about neurotechnologies that may be of interest for this FOA, please see the BRAIN website:  https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/index.htm\r\n\r\nProjects with non-exempt human subjects research will not be supported by this FOA. Such projects will not be accepted to this FOA.\r\n\r\nSee Section VIII.

These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to translate promising technologies and products to the private sector that align with their mission to improve health and save lives. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR program, as established by law and reauthorized under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834 and Public Law 115-232, is intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increase the private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal research and development funding; foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons. In addition, the STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their budget to SBIR, and those with research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside 0.45% of funds for STTR. \r\n\r\nThe SBIR/STTR program is a phased program. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. \r\n\r\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). \r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-20-261 or PA-20-265. \r\n\r\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.  \r\n\r\nNIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH Direct to Phase II will accept Phase II submissions regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award. \r\n\r\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be a strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed SBIR Phase IIB project. Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, or a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants should provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details on any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors.\r\n\r\nNIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR FOA or other specific FOAs, are listed in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives\r\n\r\nThe PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant small businesses in the development of projects that have potential for commercialization. Small business concerns that have the research capabilities and technological expertise to contribute to the R&D mission(s) of the NIH, CDC, or FDA awarding components identified in this FOA are encouraged to submit SBIR grant applications in these areas. SBIR grant applications will also be accepted and considered in any area within the mission of the Components of Participating Organizations listed for this FOA. In addition to the general SBIR solicitations, some awarding components have additional, specific NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities of potential interest to small businesses. \r\n\r\nApplicants are not required to identify a potential awarding component prior to submission of the application but may request one on the Assignment Request Form. Staff within the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR) office, the single receiving point for all NIH, CDC, and FDA grant applications, will assign all applications to the most appropriate Agency and Institute/Center (IC) based on their mission and the science proposed. For specific information about the mission of each NIH IC, visit the List of NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices website.\r\n\r\nAll applications submitted to this Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement must propose clinical trial(s). SBIR applications that do not propose clinical trial(s) should be submitted to PA-20-260.\r\n\r\nApplicants should note that some ICs only accept applications proposing mechanistic studies through this funding opportunity announcement and are noted in the PHS 2020-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. A mechanistic study is designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. If the proposed research project includes clinical trial other than a mechanistic study that would be assigned to one of these ICs, applicants are advised to contact relevant Scientific/Research staff to discuss alternative mechanisms of support of these studies.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the SBIR and STTR programs can be found at https://sbir.nih.gov/. Frequently asked questions are available to assist applicants and can answer many basic questions about the program.\r\n\r\n",

                "topic_description": "\r\n\t\r\n\t\tFetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most widely used growth supplement for cell culture; it cost-effectively supports the survival, growth, and differentiation of many cell lines by providing nutrients, growth signals, and protection from stress. Although serum is an effective growth promoter, it is variable in its composition, activity, and effects on cellular phenotypes. This variability introduces inconsistencies into research using cultured cells. Sometimes it is possible to replicate experimental results only if the same manufacturer&#39;s serum is used; sometimes replication is only possible using serum from the same lot. Vendor literature and scientific reviews advise investigators to test lots of serum to identify those that support the desired cellular responses, and then buy a quantity of the best lot for long term use. This practice is widespread but can make replication of results by others difficult.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum contains hundreds, perhaps thousands, of constituents. These include macromolecules, small molecules, and trace elements; for any cell line a large and variable subset of these may be active in supporting cell growth. The composition and concentrations of factors in serum vary with the source animals&#39; diets, geographical locations, gestational stages, gender, health, season of harvesting, and histories of exposures to hormones, antibiotics, and environmental chemicals. Harvesting practices, manufacturing processes and additives, and differences in quality control and handling introduce additional variation. Serum is a byproduct of the meat-processing industry; dependence on serum is a barrier to translation of cell-based therapies because of the risk of transmission of viruses, prions, endotoxins, and immunogens.\r\n\r\n\t\tSerum supplies factors that support cell growth through mechanisms that are not well understood, but includes hormones, enzymes, extracellular vesicles and proteins, extracellular matrix constituents, attachment and spreading factors, vitamins and minerals, trace elements, lipids, protease inhibitors, and other stabilizing and detoxifying factors. Substitute formulations for serum are expensive and time-consuming to develop and are cell-type specific; some cell lines cannot be grown with presently-available serum replacements. Although serum substitutes can support the growth of many cell types in culture, they often do not support robust survival and the same range of responses as does serum. Thus, serum continues to be widely used in many research settings where it is not economically practical to customize substitutes for it.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) addresses the needs of developers and users for supporting technologies and products to expedite (a) development of better serum substitutes, (b) identification of serum constituents that are effective in promoting the culture and responses of specific cell lines, and (c) troubleshooting of experimental variation stemming from variability in serum. This FOA will support SBIR projects to develop reliable and cost-effective tools; projects may develop new technologies or improve upon existing technologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSynthetic serum replacements, both general purpose and specialized for particular cell types. Development of minimal base formulations for customization by users into serum substitutes for specific cell lines.\r\n\t\t\tGeneral purpose analytical tools to detect constituents in serum. Tools for rapid evaluation of variation in serum composition, and for comparison of serum batches.\r\n\t\t\tSpecialized methods, tools and products for identification and evaluation of factors and activities in serum affecting adherence, survival and phenotypes of particular cell types.\r\n\t\t\tDevelopment of bioactive products for inclusion in serum replacements or to supplement reduced media, such as components that would assist the adherence of cells and promote correct morphology.\r\n\t\t\tAffordable methods for production of serum components such as growth factors.\r\n\t\t\tToolkits to assist users to develop serum replacements.\r\n\t\t\tMethods, tools, and products for detecting and clearing biological and chemical contaminants, such as viruses, prions, endotoxins, immunogens, etc.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\tSee Section VIII.
